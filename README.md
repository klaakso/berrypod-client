# BerryPod Client

This project is built using the latest available version of NativeScript with Angular 2.

It is strongly recommended to use Genymotion as the Android emulator. Because everyone says it's better than the AVD one.

```
// Get the latest version of NativeScript CLI
npm install -g nativescript@latest

// Install dependencies
tns install

// Add your target platforms
tns platform add android

// Start the app on your connected device
tns livesync android --watch
```
